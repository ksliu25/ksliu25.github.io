            K: That's another part of the question is that -- the last one to two years you started taking it more seriously because, you realized, you know, we're at the age you have a job, what do you do next? Nobody really spells it out to you.

            D: Nobody really spells it out for you, yeah.

            K: And all your friends, I'm sure you have friends that aren't creators. It almost scares me when I hear their stories. 'What have you been up to?' 'Not much, just living life.'

            A: I just feel sad, like I feel like if everyone could be creating how much better things could be or how much more interesting things could be.

            K: It's sad that a small percentage enjoy -- well maybe I realized that certain conditions led me to be more creative. I wish I was more expressive as a child though, that my family embraced the arts.

            D: My family really didn't either though, I mean my brother is actually -- he's a senior this year and so he's trying to go to Indiana University. They have a really good music school -- the jacob's school of music. So my brother plays in the Chicago youth symphony orchestra.

            A: What does he play?

            D: The violin. But you know how there's a lot of Asian kids get pushed into it and they sort of just do it? My parents pushed me and Cindy into violin, but that's only because the school we were going to -- CPS -- starting 4th grade you're allowed to join the orchestra but they also pull you out of class for a half hour every single day. So then you have like one on one lessons with the violin teacher so my mom was like "Take advantage of that! This is a great time for you to learn english one-on-one with someone" so that was their motivation actually. 

            D: So by the time my brother got to school, they were just kinda like, whatever. But then he picked up the violin and he's really really passionate about it. For a really long time my parents were skeptical like maybe they should push him into engineering. But what I told my parents -- you know violin is really expensive -- trips, lessons, really nice violins -- like my brother is going to Prague at the end of June to tour with the CSO and tour around, thats another $4000. But I told my parents, do you know how rare it is for someone to be able to do something they love for the rest of their life as their career?

            . . .

            K: I meet people that resign themselves -- or don't give it a shot to do things. They say "I'm just not good at that". Did you really give it a shot though?

            D: I think it's a complacency sort of thing, it's easier.

            A: It's comfortable to just have a steady job.

            D: I think partly too you have to surround yourself with people that are trying to make things happen. I think it's also discouraging to push through on your own. Like when you're first starting out.

            A: What do you want the people looking at your illustrations to get out of them?

            D: So my process is very laissez faire -- I just put pen to paper and draw it out if it looks cool. There's nothing like there's an image in my mind and I have to draw it out, But then I'll go back to old pieces and realize what I drew inspiration from. So I think because of that the work sort of comes out and I realize that people project themselves or project whatever they want to onto these pieces. It's interesting because I think it gives people a space to explore themselves even if it's my art. It's really interesting to to receive feedback from different people about how different pieces make them feel. Like I drew this monster looking character that says "Hello good vibes". My good friend bought it and he let me know that the other day he looked at it on his wall and thought "Hell yeah, hello good vibes."

            D: So yeah, I think subconsciously consciously your art or whatever things you create is a really heavy reflection of yourself. For awhile I thought "yeah I like to draw" but I didn't know what beetle-bob means to me. It just happened but I never really thoguth about why art or why I should keep continuing with it aside from "when I draw it makes me happy".
