   The benefits of version control are obvious. It's like saving a word document over and over but keeping track of that entire log so that you can go to any version at any point in time.

   Git helps you keep track of changes much easier by keeping them in a centralized place on the internet. Just like you can keep files on a flash drive, now you can put it on the internet like DropBox. That is just like Git and Github!

   You can use Github to keep track of your changes and share repositories easily. Bitbucket is another alternative but it is certainly not as pretty.
