      I'm sure I'll come back to this post and expand on it much more when my blog's looking not so much like... well this. But I love talking about this subject and I love the approach DBC has taken. It's actually the sole reason why I chose to come here. The idea of a fixed and growth mindset, I think, is pretty intuitive to most people, but it's <italic>not</italic> something people really consider.

      I think most people in this undertaking are already of the growth mindset. Chances are, the average DBC student is somebody that's taken a lot of time and thought to get where they are now. So, I think they're going to at least sip a little bit of the koolaid that's being served up here at camp DBC (at least I think so). But it's hard for someone that hasn't spent the time, thought, and not to mention money, on something that might seem ridiculous to them.
