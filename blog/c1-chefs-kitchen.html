    I was actually able to see a similar talk a while back when I was researching for which bootcamp to attend. What really stood out to me was their emphasis on being a "world class beginner" and "exposing" your ignorance. To me, that is really saying that you need to leave your insecurities at the door and own up to anything you don't understand. It's not about posturing, or "how much you know", it's how much you're willing to learn and put yourself out there. It's a stark contrast to the other bootcamps out there and extremely humbling.

      A more candid <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-Dev-Bootcamps-acceptance-rate">search on google revealed</a> a bit more of DBC's defense in their application process. I really loved it. They did not compare themselves to AppAcademy directly or any other bootcamps, they wanted to <i>reject</i> this notion entirely, stating that they put more weight towards effective communication, listening, and a conviction to learn rather than "proving" one's self.
