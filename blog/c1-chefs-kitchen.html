    I was actually able to see a similar talk a while back when I was researching for which bootcamp to attend. What really stood out to me was their belief in themselves and emphasis on being a "world class beginner". It's a stark contrast to the other bootcamps out there and extremely humbling.

    I prepared for Appacademy rigorously, and at the very end they have you using APIs and recreating a bubble sort and yadda yadda. That was just for the application alone,  and at that point I incorrectly assumed "Oh wow, AppAcademy must be the best, they have you do so much work!"

    But if you think about it more closely, it's just their schtick since their barrier to entry has to be much higher if their payment structure is later. DevBootcamp's is phase 0 and its tuition, but their emphasis on holistic learning and inclusivity for anyone willing to put themselves out there is what changed my mind for me.
