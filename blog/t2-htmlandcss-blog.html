      I did my research on Classes and IDs and found that IDs must be unique in naming each time and are referenced as #ID in the stylesheet. Where as classes are used frequently to reference frequently used and like items with a fullstop period .classes.

      What is appropriate to use is a case-by-case basis and important when laying out the look of the file if you are following DBCs guidelines on proper HTML and CSS formatting. In this case I plan to follow the analogy that HTML is a skeleton of the code whereas CSS is the flesh and bone, doing all of the formatting. As a result I don't do any inline changes at all.
