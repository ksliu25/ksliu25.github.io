      So it turns out my line of thinking is pretty random. What do I mean by this? Looking at the following <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html"> website </a> tests your thinking style.  Now I want to first start out that it wasn't until <i>very</i> recently that I realized I had a fixed mindset, deep down, all these years. It's insane really, if you think about it. When people say "Believe in yourself" it almost ties together with the growth mindset. It's not just encouragement, it's really asking yourself to be fully aware of your abilities, your insecurities, and piss in the wind in the face of it all. Anyways, it turns out I'm <b>Abstract Random</b> and <b>Concrete Random</b> when it comes to the VARK learning style.

      Supposedly, that means that I'm "an experimenter and one that thrives in unstructured and people-oriented environments". Now that's all well and good, but it's important to note that taking this test on a different day I sometimes get different results. What it has made me do, however, is think about how I <i>do</i> interpret problems and solve them the way I do... if I solve them. Suffice to say, it's a bag of tricks.
