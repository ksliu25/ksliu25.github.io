      A subject I routinely hear about is sexism in tech. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32115446">This</a> recent article from bbc drums up all the basic data you need to get up to speed, so I suggest heading on over there.

      This is a subject I know very little about as I haven't been in tech for very long... if at all. However, though different, I liken this a lot to racism in the workforce as well. Though they are different problems, I believe understanding awareness and empathy may help ease the situation.
